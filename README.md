This is a Python-based app, which implements facial biometrics with the Face-Recognition library, to allow hypothetical levels of access for a top secret document at Brazillian Ministery of Environment. It was made for an University project, looking for an image-processing and computer-vision algorithm.

To run it properly, you may need install CMake and Dlib libraries.
